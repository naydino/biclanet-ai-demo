BiclaNet AI-Assisted Dashboard Demo (Milestone 2)

Creative Computing & AI – IADE 2025

This demo shows how our group is integrating machine learning predictions and AI-assisted visualizations into the BiclaNet operator dashboard.

It is a lightweight prototype built in HTML/CSS/JavaScript + p5.js, using simulated ML outputs exported as JSON files.

Purpose of this Demo

Milestone 2 requires:

A simple machine-learning model trained on simulated or collected data

Demonstration of how AI/ML integrates into our system

Creative programming elements that visualize the data

A clear link between ML predictions → AI insights → UI/UX

This demo satisfies the requirement by:

Loading predicted occupancy data (predictions.json)

Computing Predicted Usage (24h) and a mini forecast visualization

Showing AI Optimization recommendations (ai_optimizations.json)

Rendering a Live System Activity p5.js visualization, driven by predicted usage

Displaying a Live AI Activity Log that animates new inference events

Everything is intentionally simple, understandable, and easy to extend later.

AI & ML Components
1. Simulated Machine Learning Output (predictions.json)

Generated by Inge’s ML model (or manually for now).

Fields include:

pod_id

timestamp

occupancy_rate (0–1)

The dashboard loads this file and computes:

Predicted Usage (24h) – average of the prediction values

A mini forecast chart to visualize temporal patterns

A comfort level (used later in the mobile app screen)

2. AI Optimization Recommendations (ai_optimizations.json)

JSON file representing higher-level AI reasoning:

Pod relocation suggestions

Dynamic pricing recommendations

Maintenance windows

These are displayed in the dark “AI Optimizations” panel.

3. Live System Activity (p5.js Visualization)

An animated band built with p5.js representing:

AI processing load

Pod signal flow

System “heartbeat”

The animation changes speed and amplitude based on ML predictions:
window.setActivityLevel(avgOccupancy);

This shows a clear ML → AI → Visualization chain.

4. Live AI Activity Log

Displays time-stamped “AI inference events” every few seconds:

“Updated forecast for POD-GCT-001A…”

“Recomputing comfort scores…”

“Checking anomaly risk…”

This imitates real-time AI workload.
